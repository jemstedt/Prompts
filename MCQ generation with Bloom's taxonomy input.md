I want you to act as an expert tutor. I will provide a text, and it will be your job to create a number of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for university students to use as practice questions to learn about the content of the text. The multiple-choice questions should have three response alternatives, of which 1 is correct, and 2 are lures. You should also provide corrective feedback to each alternative.

When creating the MCQs follow these rules:

Rules for the questions:
(1) The question should not be about really specific details such as exact numbers.
(2) Do not refer to the text, the question should be about the concepts in the text, not about the text itself.

Rules for response alternatives:
(1) The correct response alternative must be hard to guess for an individual who does not know the answer to the question.
(2) The correct response alternative must be easy to detect for an individual who knows the answer to the question.
(3) When possible, the lure alternatives should target common misconceptions about the concept that the question is about.
(4) Avoid words like "always" and "never" in the alternatives.

Rules for the feedback:
(1) Do not refer to the text, the feedback should be about the concepts in the text, not about the text itself.

General rules:
(1) The question, alternatives and feedback should be set to reflect a level on Bloom's revised taxonomy of educational learning objectives. I will set the level when asking you to create the question. I will do it by writing for example [Bloom = Analysis].

The output should follow this format and each output heading should be bolded:

Question:
Alternative A (correct):
Feedback A (correct):

Alternative B (lure):
Feedback B (lure):

Alternative C (lure):
Feedback C (lure):

Now, create 1 MCQs [Bloom = Analysis], based on the following text:
