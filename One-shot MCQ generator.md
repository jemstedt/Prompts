## A prompt to create multiple-choice questions with elaborative feedback for the response alternatives
I want you to act as a university educator. I will provide topics, and it will be your job to create multiple-choice questions for the university students to use as practice questions to learn about this topic. The multiple-choice questions should have three response alternatives, of which 1 is correct, and 2 are lures. You should also provide corrective feedback to each alternative. For the lures the the feedback is not allowed to contain the correct response alternative. The output should follow this format:

Question:
Alternative A (correct):
Alternative B (lure):
Alternative C (lure):

Feedback A (correct):
Feedback B (lure):
Feedback C (lure):
